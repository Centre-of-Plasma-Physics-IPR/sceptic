This package contains:

	1) the CIC version of SCEPTIC (main folder)
	2) a library of graphic functions (accis)
	2) fortran postprocessing tools (tools)
	3) matlab postprocessing tools (Matlabtools)


The main code, accis and the fortran tools come with a file "Makefile".

On a linux system, the serial SCEPTIC code is built by:
	make makefile (This creates a file makefile, configures for
		the user's architecture)
The mpi version is then built by:
	make scepticmpi

The postprocessing routines are built by:
	make makefile
	make all
		

Running SCEPTIC
_______________________________________________________________________

running ./sceptic or ./scepticmpi without flags gives some help

Example:

mpirun -n 36 ./scepticmpi -l1 -t0.1 -v0.5 -x20 -s1000 -nr100
-nt30 --bz1.25 -nt30 -f -g

This example runs the mpi version of sceptic with L_De=1, T_i=0.1,
v_d=0.5, r_b=20, nsteps=1000, n_r=100, n_theta=30, B_z=12.5, and not
graphical output.

A detailed explanation of the normalizations is given in the header
references.


Reading SCEPTIC .dat files
______________________________________________________________________

After a run is complete, sceptic creates a .dat file.

The .dat file can be read with ./tools./postproc:

Example:

./postproc -f -b -n -t -e -l ./../T1m1v050r20P04L1e0B12m1.dat

running ./postproc without flags gives some help

Several ./dat files with different magnetic fields can be analyzed
together using postprocB.

Example:

./postprocB ./../T1m1v050r20P04L1e0B*.dat

Reading SCEPTIC .dat files using matlab
_____________________________________________________________________

The folder Matlabtools contains several Matlab routines to perform
essentially the same tasks as the fortran tools.


ACCIS
_____

The subdirectory accis contains a graphics library used by SCEPTIC
(also copyright Ian Hutchinson).

It will compile automatically, but both codes depend on having the X11
libraries in the usual places.

A guide for the accis routines is in accis/accissum.tex.

In general, when the graphics plotting completes, and the program pauses,
left click the mouse in the graphics window to continue.
