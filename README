This package contains the CIC version of SCEPTIC. On a linux system the
code is built by giving the command

make

Running ./sceptic will then give a usage message.

ACCIS
_____

The subdirectory accis contains a graphics library used by SCEPTIC
(also copyright Ian Hutchinson).

It will compile automatically, but both codes depend on having the X11
libraries in the usual places.

A guide for the accis routines is in accis/accissum.tex.

In general, when the graphics plotting completes, and the program pauses,
left click the mouse in the graphics window to continue.

Tools
_____

A few codes for plotting and analysing the output of SCEPTIC are in
the tools directory.
